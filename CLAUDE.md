## 🚨 MANDATORY: Development Process

**All development work MUST follow the Standard Operating Procedure.**

📚 **Required Reading for All Agents:**
- **[SOP: Development Workflow](picasso-config-builder/docs/SOP_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)** - Complete workflow from requirements to production with phase-based agent orchestration
- **[Agent Responsibility Matrix](picasso-config-builder/docs/AGENT_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md)** - Agent selection guide, capabilities, and collaboration patterns

**For Orchestrator Agents:**
- Follow phase-based workflow (Phase 0-5) defined in SOP
- Use agent invocation templates for consistency
- Track phase gates and validation checkpoints
- Manage handoffs between agents with explicit input/output artifacts
- See "Standard Task Workflow" section in SOP for detailed agent workflows

**For Individual Specialized Agents:**
- Refer to your specific responsibilities in the Agent Responsibility Matrix
- Follow invocation templates when deployed
- Deliver artifacts specified in phase workflows
- Validate deliverables against success criteria

**Quick Command:** Type `/follow-sop` to load SOP context

## 🧠 Working Principles (always in effect)

These behavioral rules apply to every task in this repo. They counter common LLM coding failure modes — overcomplication, speculative abstraction, scope creep, satisficing.

### 1. Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask. If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't silently pick one. If a simpler approach exists, say so. If something is unclear, stop and name what's confusing rather than inventing an interpretation.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code. No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested. No error handling for impossible scenarios. If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite. Ask yourself: "would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Don't refactor things that aren't broken. Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently. If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it. Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Transform tasks into verifiable success criteria before coding. "Add validation" → "write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass." "Fix the bug" → "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass." For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with per-step verify checks. Strong criteria let you loop independently; weak criteria force constant clarification.

A per-turn hook re-injects a condensed form of these on every message to counter long-session drift.

## 🏗️ Deployment Model & SOP (post-P0, established 2026-05-04)

The platform runs across **3 isolated AWS accounts** under one Organization. Account boundaries enforce isolation — code in dev/staging cannot reach prod resources, period. New work goes into staging first, gets validated, then promotes to prod via a per-resource cutover decision.

### Account topology

Three AWS accounts under one Organization: **prod** (hand-managed legacy; receives new resources only via deliberate Phase 2 promotion), **staging** (where features live for demos + soak; PowerUserAccess, no IAM tampering), and **dev** (engineer + AI agent iteration; destructible; AdministratorAccess).

**Account IDs, SSO profile names, and the SSO portal URL** live in the operator-local memory file `~/.claude/projects/-Users-chrismiller-Desktop-Working-Folder/memory/reference_aws_accounts.md` (operator-local, not in this repo). Agents with checkout access typically have access to that memory file; agents without it should ask the operator.

### Deployment SOP

1. **Develop locally or in dev account**. Engineers + AI agents have AdministratorAccess in dev; can do destructive things without risk.
2. **Promote to staging via Terraform**. New resources defined in `infra/` directory. PR → CI runs `terraform plan` against staging and posts comment. Merge to `staging` long-lived branch (when created) → CI runs `apply`.
3. **Soak in staging**. Demos run against `staging.chat.myrecruiter.ai`. Validate end-to-end including dashboards, alarms, etc.
4. **Promote to prod via per-resource cutover**. NOT a `terraform import` of existing prod resources. Instead: deploy new clean-shape resources in prod alongside the existing hand-managed ones, switch traffic (tenant config, DNS, etc.), decommission old.

### Hard rules (do not violate)

- **Never `terraform apply` against the prod account during normal feature work.** Prod is hand-managed today. Phase 2 cutover decisions are explicit, gated, and rare.
- **Never share IAM roles across Lambdas.** Each Lambda gets a dedicated execution role. (lambda#44 was the result of historical sharing — don't recreate that pattern.)
- **Never share one physical resource across environments, and never put an environment token in a resource name.** The AWS account boundary IS the environment (525 staging / 614 prod / dev), so isolation is structural: a `picasso-audit` in staging and a `picasso-audit` in prod are *different physical resources in different accounts*, never a shared one. **Target naming convention: bare `picasso-<name>`, identical across accounts** — NOT `{name}-{env}`. An env token in the name separates nothing (the account already does) and blocks clean staging↔prod promotion. New resources are created bare from day one; the CI guard `scripts/check-ddb-naming.sh` enforces this for DynamoDB tables. Legacy `-{env}`-suffixed resources are being migrated to bare — see [`docs/roadmap/ENVIRONMENT_NAMING_PARITY_PLAN.md`](docs/roadmap/ENVIRONMENT_NAMING_PARITY_PLAN.md). (This overturns the prior "use the `{name}-{env}` convention" rule, which was the policy-level root cause of the staging/prod naming drift.)
- **Do not rotate the legacy operator IAM credentials used by legacy CI workflows.** Specific credential name + rotation policy in the operator-local `reference_aws_accounts.md` memory file.
- **Always `unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` before running terraform.** Stale exported credentials override AWS_PROFILE and trigger SSO 401 errors.
- **Dry-run before destroy — always.** Any command that can delete or bulk-overwrite production data (`aws s3 sync --delete`, `aws s3 rm`, `delete-*`, bulk copies over live prefixes) MUST first run with `--dryrun`/equivalent and have its output reviewed in the same session, immediately before the real invocation. Destructive REHEARSALS/drills never target production resources directly — use a scratch prefix or stay dryrun-only. (D10 incident, 2026-06-12: a rollback drill run without a dryrun deleted the live widget bucket's objects for ~6 minutes; the dryrun that would have prevented it also exposed that the CI rollback step itself was broken. Full forensics: `project_ci_modernization_phase2_audit_2026-06-11.md`.)
- **Every production bucket keeps S3 versioning Enabled.** It is the recovery path of last resort (it saved the D10 incident). Never suspend it; new prod buckets enable it at creation. Detection side: `prod-synthetic-monitor.yml` probes the prod entry points every ~10 min and pings Slack on failure.

### Local Terraform usage

```bash
aws sso login --profile myrecruiter-dev          # or staging/prod
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
cd infra
AWS_PROFILE=myrecruiter-dev terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend/dev.tfbackend
AWS_PROFILE=myrecruiter-dev terraform plan -var-file=envs/dev.tfvars
AWS_PROFILE=myrecruiter-dev terraform apply -var-file=envs/dev.tfvars
```

CI deploys via OIDC into per-account `GitHubActionsDeployRole`. See `.github/workflows/infra-deploy.yml`.

### Adding a new resource

1. Create or extend module under `infra/modules/<name>/` — name resources **bare** (`picasso-<name>`, no env token; see Hard rules)
2. Reference from `infra/main.tf`
3. Plan + apply in dev account first
4. Plan + apply in staging account
5. (Phase 2 only, with explicit gate) plan + apply in prod account

### Stale-branch `terraform plan` literacy (do not panic)

A `terraform plan` showing a large `N to destroy`/`must be replaced` on a feature branch is **almost always staleness, not real drift** — a branch behind `main` lacks modules `main` already applied, so its plan wants to destroy them. **Before believing a scary plan: rebase on `origin/main` (or run it from a fresh `origin/main` checkout) and re-plan.** The authoritative drift signal is the **CI plan on a PR up-to-date with `main`**, not a local plan from an old branch. (A 466-behind branch once produced a `184 to destroy` plan that read as a data-loss emergency; `origin/main` showed `0 to destroy`. See `docs/roadmap/ENVIRONMENT_NAMING_PARITY_PLAN.md` §0.)

### Where the legacy commands below fit

The `Commands` section below documents direct AWS CLI deploys to prod-account resources via a legacy operator IAM profile. **Those are legacy operations against the hand-managed prod resources.** They continue to work for backward compatibility but new resources should be Terraform-managed via the SOP above. Existing prod resources stay manually managed until each is intentionally cut over.

### CI/CD pipeline state (current — CI-modernization program, plan: `ci_modernization/docs/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md`)

The legacy direct-`aws s3 sync`/`update-function-code` commands in the `Commands` section still work, but the **CI/CD-modernization program** is the supported path. State as of 2026-06-12:

**Front-ends (widget, analytics-dashboard, config-builder) — one reusable shape.**
- All three deploy through the reusable `picasso/.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` (Phase 2.1). It does: download artifact → (prod) archive immutable `s3://<bucket>/releases/<sha>/` → sync live (cache-split: 1-yr immutable hashed assets vs short-cache entry points) → CloudFront invalidate → retried smoke → (prod) **auto-rollback on failed smoke**.
- **Prod deploys are dispatch-only and gated**: `gh workflow run` → approval gate(s) → reusable deploys. Push to `main` runs quality gates + build only. PRs deploy a staging preview.
- **Caller-pin convention**: the widget calls the reusable via **local path** (`uses: ./…` — same commit, no skew). dash + pcb pin a **specific SHA** (`@<sha>`, not `@main`) — a `@main` ref lets a reusable change `startup_failure` the caller with no warning (the picasso#494 class). **Bump the pin deliberately in both `deploy-production.yml` and `pr-checks.yml`** to adopt reusable changes.
- **Rollback** = re-sync a prior `releases/<sha>/` prefix. Auto-rollback restores it **download-then-upload** (NEVER an S3→S3 `sync --delete` from under `releases/` — the `--exclude releases/*` poisons the delete manifest and wipes the live bucket; the D10 incident, 2026-06-12). Empty-source abort guard added.
- **Detection**: `prod-synthetic-monitor.yml` probes the prod entry points (widget.js, iframe.html, MFS health, /stream) every ~10 min and Slack-pings on failure.

**Lambdas (`Lambdas/lambda/`) — per-function matrix workflows.**
- `deploy-staging.yml`: on merge to `main`, auto-deploys each **touched** Lambda's code to its staging-account (525) function via OIDC `GitHubActionsDeployRole`. Staging is `$LATEST`-only (rollback = redeploy a prior commit). Matrix maps `source_dir` (some keep historical `_Staging` suffix) → bare staging function name.
- `deploy-production.yml`: **dispatch-only**, one function per run. MFS uses the **alias model** (`live` alias flip = the deploy; auto-rolls the alias back on failed smoke); BSH/ADA are `$LATEST` + an immutable version snapshot. Smoke retries 15×12s (the AWS_IAM Function-URL auth plane lags `update-function-code` >30s). Env/resource shape is **not** managed here — Terraform owns it (one writer per resource).

**IaC (`infra/`).**
- **Staging belt**: `infra/` applies to the staging account (525) via CI OIDC. New resources go here first (per the Deployment SOP above).
- **Prod**: hand-managed today; brought under Terraform only via deliberate, gated cutover (Phase 3 / prod-IaC program — Tier-3 import, MFS-prod module, scheduled drift detection). **Never `terraform apply` un-targeted against prod.**
- The staging chat twins were **de-suffixed** (task 2.5, complete 2026-06-11): staging `Master_Function` + `Bedrock_Streaming_Handler` are now bare-named (account = environment), matching the newer staging functions.

**Program status**: Phases 0+1 closed; Phase 2 = 2.1/2.3/2.5 done, 2.2 rollback-rehearsal + 2.4 queue-recheck (~2026-06-24) open; Phase 4 core (gate pings, release notes, auto-rollback) shipped; Phase 3 is prod-IaC-owned. The fail-safe **Hard rules** above (dry-run before destroy; prod buckets keep versioning) are load-bearing — they came out of the D10 incident.

## 🧬 Schema Discipline (forward-compatible reads)

**Rule:** every reader of a stored record (DynamoDB row, tenant config section, request body, S3 object, etc.) must tolerate missing fields. New fields are additive — old data without them must not crash any reader.

**How to apply:**
- Python: `item.get('field', default)` — never `item['field']` for optional fields.
- Node/TS: `item.field ?? default` or destructuring with defaults — never bracket access without nullish coalescing on optional fields.
- When a PR adds a field to a stored record type, the PR MUST add a contract / fixture test that exercises the reader against an old-shape record (without the new field). If the reader crashes on the old shape, the PR fails CI.

**Why:** dev/staging/prod are isolated by AWS account boundary; only customer data lives in prod. Code promotes forward; data does not. New code deployed to prod will encounter pre-existing prod data that lacks fields added during dev. Forward-compatible reads is the discipline that keeps account isolation safe — without it, a routine deploy can break prod.

**Reference pattern:** Issue #5's `analytics_writer_contract.json` — both Python and Node writers produce identical wire format AND the test fixture covers `attribute_not_exists` initial-state cases. Replicate this pattern whenever a stored record type changes shape.

---

## 🛡️ PII Governance Project

**Goal (verbatim user quote, 2026-05-19):** *"Design MyRecruiter/Picasso so personal information is collected intentionally, stored minimally, protected by default, separated by tenant, retained only as long as needed, and easy to disclose, export, delete, or anonymize later."*

**Operational translation:** manage the data that we control and keep it safe, while adhering to best efforts for legal compliance.

**Source of truth:** [`docs/roadmap/PII-Project/README.md`](docs/roadmap/PII-Project/README.md) (the "MyRecruiter / Picasso PII Governance Strategy and Advisory Agent Guide"). All PII project docs live under [`docs/roadmap/PII-Project/`](docs/roadmap/PII-Project/).

The sections below (Advisory Model, PII Review Triggers, Agent Routing, Employment / Hiring Trigger, Background Check Caution) are verbatim inserts from that strategy doc. The Living-Inventory PR Rule at the bottom is the only added discipline rule (closes gap G-B from the 2026-05-19 plan gaps review).

## Compliance and Governance Advisory Model

Compliance-related agents in this project serve an advisory role during planning, architecture, implementation, and code review.

They do not:
- make final legal determinations
- provide legal advice
- block development by default
- replace qualified legal counsel
- determine whether MyRecruiter is legally compliant

They do:
- identify privacy, consent, AI governance, nonprofit, donor, volunteer, communications, and consumer-protection risks
- recommend safer technical, product, UX, and documentation patterns
- suggest data minimization and logging controls
- flag issues that may require attorney review
- help technical agents convert risk findings into implementable work
- produce audit-friendly notes for future review

Compliance advisors should be invoked early in planning, not only after code is written.

---

## PII Review Triggers

Before production, require PII/Data Lifecycle advisory review for any feature that:
- collects name, email, phone, address, IP, session ID, or chat transcript content
- stores or displays form submissions
- sends data to Bubble, n8n, Sheets, CRM, email, SMS, analytics, or another third party
- changes logging behavior
- changes tenant identity, tenant hash, config lookup, or access control
- stores raw transcripts
- generates AI summaries, labels, scores, or classifications about a person
- sends email or SMS follow-up
- introduces user deletion/export/access workflows
- touches minors, foster care, families, health, disability, legal, financial, crisis, or background-check-related information

â compliance-implementation-advisor

---

## Employment / Hiring Compliance Trigger

MyRecruiter/Picasso does not currently recruit employees. The current compliance scope is nonprofit volunteers, donors, supporters, and website visitors.

If any feature begins to:
- collect employee applicant data,
- screen or rank job candidates,
- recommend hiring decisions,
- process resumes,
- evaluate employment eligibility,
- conduct interview scoring,
- integrate with ATS systems for paid roles,
- or use AI for employment-related decisions,

Claude must stop and recommend creation of a dedicated Employment, FCRA, EEOC, and AI Hiring Compliance Advisor before implementation continues.

---

## Background Check Caution

Picasso should not evaluate background-check results, recommend acceptance/rejection, summarize consumer reports, or make placement recommendations based on background-check data unless qualified counsel has reviewed the workflow.

---

## Living-Inventory PR Rule

Any PR that adds (or modifies the PII shape of) a DynamoDB table, Lambda, S3 prefix, or CloudWatch log group that holds PII MUST update [`docs/roadmap/PII-Project/pii-inventory.md`](docs/roadmap/PII-Project/pii-inventory.md) in the same PR, and classify the new/changed surface against the tiers in [`docs/roadmap/PII-Project/data-classification.md`](docs/roadmap/PII-Project/data-classification.md). This keeps the inventory living (closes G-B from the 2026-05-19 plan gaps review); a snapshot inventory recreates the original failure mode.

---

## 🎯 Tenant Config Optimization

After building a tenant config in the Config Builder, invoke the optimization skill to audit and fine-tune:

- **[V4.0 Config Optimization Skill](skills/V4_CONFIG_OPTIMIZATION.skill)** — 6-step playbook for V4.0 Action Selector tenants. Covers CTA audit, tone prompt cleanup, KB optimization, and verification scenarios.

**When to use:** After creating/editing a tenant config in the Config Builder. The skill audits CTA coverage, validates formatting preferences, checks KB chunking strategy, and runs test conversations.

**Reference implementation:** Austin Angels (`AUS123957`)

**Environment separation (the names above are STAGING-account functions).** The `*_Staging` names are the **staging-account (525)** Lambdas — what these deploy commands target. Their **production** counterparts are **bare-named** in account 614: `Master_Function`, `Bedrock_Streaming_Handler` (legacy hand-managed; promoted per the Deployment SOP above, never by these staging commands). Invocation is **not uniform**: prod `Master_Function` is fronted by a `live` alias, whereas prod `Bedrock_Streaming_Handler` has **no alias** and is invoked via its Function URL (`$LATEST`, `AuthType=AWS_IAM` behind the CloudFront `/stream` Lambda@Edge signer — Remedy A #435).

## Architecture Overview

### Request Flow
1. **Picasso Widget** embeds on client websites and initiates chat sessions
2. **Master_Function_Staging** validates JWT, manages state, routes requests
3. **Routing Logic**:
   - Conversational AI → Bedrock via Streaming Handler with Knowledge Base
   - Smart Response Cards → Triggered by conversation context
   - Structured forms → Conversational collection in Picasso (replacing Lex)
4. **Bedrock_Streaming_Handler_Staging** provides SSE streaming for real-time responses

### Frontend (Picasso)
- **Build System**: ESBuild with environment-specific configs
- **Source**: `Picasso/src/` is the single Picasso source directory
- **Entry Points**:
  - `Picasso/src/widget.js` - Embeddable widget
  - `Picasso/src/iframe-main.jsx` - React app loaded in iframe
- **Chat Providers**: Multiple implementations for HTTP/SSE streaming
- **Environment Detection**: Hierarchical system (config > env vars > URL params)
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify sanitization layer

### Backend (Lambda Functions)

**Core:**
- **Master_Function_Staging** (Python 3.13):
  - JWT authentication with blacklist support
  - Multi-tenant configuration from S3
  - DynamoDB session/audit logging
  - CORS headers per environment

- **Bedrock_Streaming_Handler_Staging** (Node.js 20.x):
  - True Lambda response streaming (`awslambda.streamifyResponse`)
  - Bedrock Agent Runtime for knowledge base RAG
  - 5-minute in-memory cache
  - Claude 4.5 Haiku default model
  - **V4.0 Action Selector** (preferred): LLM-based CTA selection — focused Haiku call after response streams, picks CTAs from `ai_available` vocabulary. Gated by `feature_flags.V4_ACTION_SELECTOR`.
  - V4.1 Pool Selection (fallback): Topic classification + deterministic CTA pool filtering via `topic_definitions` and `selection_metadata`. Active when tenant has topic_definitions but no V4_ACTION_SELECTOR flag.
  - V3.5 enhanceResponse (legacy): Branch-based routing. Active when tenant has no topic_definitions.
  - Simplified locked prompt rules: SOURCE, CONTEXT, FORMATTING, CLOSING

- **Picasso_Config_Manager** (Node.js 20.x ESM):
  - Backend API for picasso-config-builder
  - S3 tenant config CRUD operations

**Analytics Pipeline:**
- **Analytics_Dashboard_API** (Python) - Backend API for analytics dashboard (DynamoDB + Athena)
- **Analytics_Event_Processor** (Python) - SQS → S3 pipeline for analytics events
- **Analytics_Aggregator** (Python) - Hourly EventBridge-triggered data aggregation
- **Aggregator_Function** (Python) - Legacy aggregation

**Tenant & Infrastructure:**
- **deploy_tenant_stack** (Python 3.13) - Tenant onboarding automation
- **SSO_Token_Generator** (Python) - SSO tokens for dashboard login
- **send_email** (Python) - Reusable email sending via SES
- **ses_event_handler** (Python) - SES bounce/complaint event handler

### Webscraping (Firecrawl SDK)
- **FirecrawlApp** - Main class for web scraping/crawling operations
- **Features**:
  - Single URL scraping and full website crawling
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Structured data extraction using Zod schemas
  - Multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, screenshots)
  - Batch operations for multiple URLs
- **RAG Scraper** (`picasso-webscraping/rag-scraper`):
  - Multi-tenant content preparation for Bedrock Knowledge Bases
  - Link-aware processing for actionable chatbot responses
  - S3 storage optimization
- **Self-Hosted Server** (`picasso-webscraping/firecrawl-server`):
  - Docker Compose deployment for local usage
  - Includes API, worker, Redis, and Playwright services

### Environment Configuration

Environments: `development`, `staging`, `production`

Required environment variables for Lambdas:
- `S3_CONFIG_BUCKET` - Tenant configurations
- `DYNAMODB_AUDIT_TABLE` - Audit logs
- `DYNAMODB_BLACKLIST_TABLE` - Token blacklist
- `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` - AI model ID

Required environment variables for Webscraping:
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - API key for Firecrawl service
- `API_URL` - API endpoint (defaults to https://api.firecrawl.dev)
- `TEST_API_KEY` - API key for running tests

## Development Workflow

Per the Developer Playbook:
1. Branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Push and create PR: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
4. Merge to main after review
5. Clean up: `git branch -d feature/my-feature`

**Key Rules:**
- Never commit directly to main
- Use feature branches for all changes
- main branch = production
- Use Sandbox/ for temporary work

### Branch routing for PRs (established 2026-05-25)

Choose the PR base branch by **what the PR contains**, not by habit:

| Contents | Base | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Pure docs that are self-contained or cite only main-promoted state (master plan revisions, D5 updates, CLAUDE.md edits, runbooks, methodology notes, SOP changes) | `main` | No production behavior change; no soak needed; routing through staging just accumulates drift. |
| Pure docs that cite live staging-only state (decision docs naming staging Lambda CodeSha256s, staging IaC ARNs, etc.) | `staging` | Doc must co-locate with the artifact it references so a reader of the same branch can verify the citation. |
| Code, IaC, or mixed (docs + code) | `staging` | Soak in staging acct 525 before promote-to-main per Deployment SOP §"Deployment SOP" above. |

**Promote-to-main pattern (when code/IaC PRs accumulate on staging):**
- Per `feedback_promote_pr_scope_discipline`: scoped promote-PRs per decision gate (e.g., "promote M9.G5 chain for prod cutover"), NOT multi-milestone bundles.
- Cherry-pick the relevant commits onto a branch from main; do NOT merge staging into main wholesale.
- A promote-PR's diff must be **reviewable as the work being promoted** — not "everything that's been accumulating since last promote."

**Why this rule exists:** before 2026-05-25, all PII work uniformly targeted staging by habit. Pure-docs (master plan revisions, decision docs without staging citations) accumulated on staging with no production gate to trigger promotion, growing to a 30+ commit backlog. Routing docs directly to main when they don't depend on staging-only state shrinks the drift without losing soak discipline for code/IaC.

**Operational prerequisite:** the `Deploy to Production` workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` has `paths-ignore: [docs/**, **/*.md]` on the `push.main` trigger (added in picasso#225/#226), so pure-docs PRs targeting main do NOT trigger the production deploy pipeline. Mixed-content PRs (docs + code) still trigger the workflow per GitHub paths-ignore semantics.

### Drift hard-cap (established 2026-05-26)

**Rule:** `origin/staging` ↔ `origin/main` divergence MUST NOT exceed **5 merge commits (≈ 5 PRs of unpromoted work) in either direction** at session close. If exceeded, the session ends with a promote-PR opened (and, if reverse drift also exceeds 5, a back-sync PR opened).

**Verifier (one command):**

```bash
echo "staging → main: $(git rev-list --count --merges origin/main..origin/staging)"
echo "main → staging: $(git rev-list --count --merges origin/staging..origin/main)"
```

**Why `--merges` (changed 2026-05-28):** the prior verifier counted *all* commits, but feature PRs merged into staging with "Create a merge commit" each contribute **2** commits to a plain `rev-list --count` — the merge commit AND the feature commit(s) underneath it. That double-counting tripped the 5-cap after only ~2-3 logical PRs (e.g. 3 PRs showed as 7 commits on 2026-05-28). Counting `--merges` measures what the rule actually intends: number of PRs of unpromoted work, ~1 merge commit per PR. **Caveat:** a *squash*-merged feature→staging PR produces a single non-merge commit that `--merges` will NOT count — acceptable because this repo's convention is merge-commits for these PRs (and staging↔main PRs are merge-commit-mandated below). If squash-to-staging ever becomes common, revisit this metric.

If either number > 5 at session close, the session-close hook is to:
1. Open promote-PR `base=main head=staging` titled `promote(staging→main): <one-line summary of scope>`
2. Open back-sync PR `base=staging head=main` after the promote-PR merges (or simultaneously if both drift directions exceed 5)
3. PR descriptions must reference this rule + cite the pre-promote counts

**MERGE STRATEGY:** staging↔main promote-PRs and back-sync PRs MUST be merged with **"Create a merge commit"** (NOT squash, NOT rebase). Squash collapses the 2-parent merge commit into a single non-merge commit, breaking parent linkage between the branches — under the old all-commits verifier this *overcounted* forever; under the `--merges` verifier it instead makes the promote *uncounted* (the metric can't see a promote that left no merge commit). Either way the metric breaks, so the merge-commit mandate stands. Established by picasso#249 (squashed → broken linkage) → picasso#250 (recovery with merge-commit strategy).

**Why this rule exists:** before 2026-05-26 the divergence had grown to **41 staging-only + 36 main-only = 77 total**. Two patterns drove the drift:
- Reflex-routing to staging from before the 2026-05-25 routing convention.
- Asymmetric routing post-convention: docs went to main, IaC went to staging, with no force pushing periodic reconciliation.

The 5-commit cap is conservative on purpose — small promote-PRs are easier to review, conflict-resolve, and roll back than 41-commit ones. Pairs with `feedback_promote_pr_scope_discipline`: scoped promote-PRs per decision gate, NOT multi-milestone bundles.

**Established by:** picasso#244 (the first scoped staging→main convergence opened explicitly to reset drift to zero, 2026-05-26).

### Force-push attestation convention (established 2026-05-25)

When force-pushing to a PR branch after CI has already passed (e.g., rebase-to-update-with-main before merge), include in the PR description a one-line attestation that the only delta vs the pre-rebase tip is the rebase parent update (no substantive content change). Example:

> **Force-push attestation 2026-05-25:** rebased onto `origin/main@<sha>` to satisfy branch-protection "up-to-date with base"; no content delta vs pre-rebase tip `<old-sha>`.

**Why:** force-push-with-lease on a feature branch rewrites the pre-rebase tip from remote reflog. For docs-only PRs this is low risk, but the attestation makes the operator's intent explicit and recoverable. Established by `project_scheduling_subphase_b_opening_phase_completion_audit_2026-05-25` audit row 24.

### Worktree & branch hygiene (established 2026-06-17)

Stale worktrees and merged local branches accumulated badly before this rule (14 worktrees + ~75 merged branches across picasso+lambda by 2026-06-17). Keep the workspace tidy:

- **An agent that creates a git worktree for a task MUST `git worktree remove <path>` once the task's PR is pushed/merged.** Never leave `/tmp/*-wt` worktrees behind. (Prefer `isolation: worktree` agents, which auto-clean.)
- **`git tidy`** (`~/bin/git-tidy`, aliased as `git tidy`) reclaims merged local branches + finished worktrees in the current repo — **safe by design**: never `--force`, and it skips the current branch, `staging`, `main`, and any dirty/locked worktree. Run it after a batch of merges; `git tidy main --dry` previews without changing anything.
- **Remote branches auto-delete on merge** (`delete_branch_on_merge=true` on picasso / lambda / picasso-config-builder / picasso-analytics-dashboard) — no manual remote-branch cleanup needed.

## Card Extraction & Forms Workflow

### Tenant Onboarding Pipeline
1. **Deploy tenant** via `deploy_tenant_stack` Lambda → Creates base config
2. **Scrape & refine KB** → Generate knowledge base document
3. **Extract cards** → `node extract-cards-from-kb.js kb.md TENANT_ID`
4. **Define forms** → Create explicit form definitions JSON
5. **Merge to config** → Combine cards + forms into tenant config
6. **Upload to S3** → Deploy enhanced config with cards and forms

### Card Extraction Tools (picasso-webscraping/rag-scraper)
- `extract-cards-from-kb.js` - Extract actionable cards from refined KB
- `merge-cards-to-config.js` - Merge cards into tenant config
- `card-extractor.js` - Core extraction logic module

### Configuration Structure
Each tenant config includes:
- **cta_definitions**: Call-to-action buttons with action types (`start_form`, `show_info`, `external_link`, `send_query`). CTAs with `ai_available: true` form the AI's vocabulary for the action selector.
- **conversational_forms**: Explicit field definitions for in-widget data collection
- **feature_flags**: Pipeline behavior toggles. Key flag: `V4_ACTION_SELECTOR` enables LLM-based CTA selection.
- **conversation_branches**: Guided multi-step paths (legacy — used by V3.5 tenants, optional for V4.0)
- **action_chips**: Quick-action buttons with explicit routing (v1.4.1 dictionary format)
- **tone_prompt**: AI persona (who it is, not how it behaves)
- **bedrock_instructions**: Formatting preferences, custom constraints, fallback message

**V4.0 Action Selector (preferred):**
- Single focused Haiku call after response streams — reads conversation + CTA vocabulary, picks 0-4 relevant CTAs
- No topic definitions, no selection_metadata, no taxonomy — the AI makes a judgment call
- Gated by `feature_flags.V4_ACTION_SELECTOR: true`
- Config optimization skill: `docs/V4_CONFIG_OPTIMIZATION.skill`
- Reference implementation: Austin Angels (`AUS123957`)

**V4.1 Pool Selection (fallback for taxonomy tenants):**
- Topic classification → deterministic CTA pool filtering via `topic_definitions` and `selection_metadata`
- Active when tenant has `topic_definitions` but no `V4_ACTION_SELECTOR` flag

**V3.5 Branch Routing (legacy):**
- `available_actions` is **deprecated**
- Active when tenant has no `topic_definitions`

## Known Configuration Notes

- Lambda functions repo is nested: `Lambdas/lambda/`
- `lambda-repo/` is a separate git clone of the same Lambda functions — prefer `Lambdas/lambda/` for changes
- Streaming requires Lambda runtime configuration
- Cache TTL is 5 minutes for Bedrock handler
- Environment detection supports multiple sources (config, env vars, URL params)
- Firecrawl SDK requires Node.js 22.0.0+ for ES modules support
- RAG scraper examples in `picasso-webscraping/rag-scraper/` for various use cases
- Analytics dashboard deployed to S3 bucket `app-myrecruiter-ai` with CloudFront `EJ0Y6ZUIUBSAT`
- Deal_prep_level-2 and Website Redesign each have their own CLAUDE.md with project-specific guidance
- `scheduling/` contains only a planning doc — no code implemented yet
- **IaC IAM string-charset gotcha:** AWS IAM `aws_iam_role`/`aws_iam_policy`/`aws_iam_role_policy` `description`/`name`/`path` accept ONLY `[\t\n\r\x20-\x7E\xA1-\xFF]` (tab/LF/CR + printable ASCII + Latin-1; `§` U+00A7 OK, but em-dash `—` U+2014 / en-dash / smart-quotes are REJECTED). `terraform validate` AND `terraform plan` PASS — it fails only at the live `apply` (often a partial apply). Before committing/applying any Terraform that adds/edits IAM resources, run `grep -rnP '[^\x09\x0A\x0D\x20-\x7E\xA1-\xFF]' infra/` and fix any hit on an IAM `description`/`name` to ASCII. KMS key descriptions have no such constraint. (Cost a partial Apply-1 failure, 2026-05-19.)
- `.firecrawl/` is a working directory for scraping operations (cached data, not source code)
