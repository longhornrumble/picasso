# 🤝 UNIFIED BERS APPROACH - SYSTEM ARCHITECT & TECH LEAD COORDINATION PLAN

**Project Coordination Document**  
**Version**: 1.0.0 - **JOINT AGREEMENT**  
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Participants**: System Architect & Tech Lead  
**Orchestrated By**: Project Orchestrator  
**Status**: **UNIFIED APPROACH AGREED**  

---

## 🎯 COORDINATION RESOLUTION SUMMARY

### CONFLICT RESOLVED
**Original Conflict:** System Architect recommended comprehensive 2-3 week BERS integration; Tech Lead preferred focused 2-4 hour fixes.

**Resolution Basis:** Evidence shows focused patching approach has failed after 2+ days, validating System Architect's original assessment. Tech Lead now agrees BERS integration is necessary.

**Unified Position:** Both agents now support security-first BERS integration with realistic timeline and comprehensive validation.
