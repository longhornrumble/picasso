# Scheduling v1 — Parallel Workstreams (coordination)

**Purpose.** Let several Claude sessions build the sub-phase C logic layer (and start the sub-phase E long pole) **in parallel** without the collision / churn / quality drift that uncoordinated parallel work produces. This doc is the operating model; it does not replace the [implementation plan](scheduling_implementation_plan.md) (the task spec) — it sits on top of it.

> **Why this exists.** On 2026-05-29 three overlapping B6 remediation efforts (lambda #177/#178/#179 + picasso #290) collided — duplicate audits, merge conflicts on shared docs, rework. That is the failure mode this doc prevents. The rule that prevents it: **parallelize the *building*, single-thread the *integration*.**

```

- **Build = parallel.** Each workstream is one session, one feature branch, a **disjoint set of new modules** it exclusively owns. Agents never touch each other's files or the shared docs.
- **Integration = single-threaded.** One integrator session weaves the PRs in dependency order, runs the risk-calibrated audit on the security-sensitive ones, updates the shared docs in one pass, and manages the drift-cap / promote cadence.
- **The seam between workstreams = [FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md](FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md).** Agents code *against* the frozen contracts; they never redefine one. A contract change is escalated to the integrator, not edited unilaterally.

---

## 2. Roles

| Role | Who | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Integrator** | one designated session (default: the orchestrating/main session) | Authors + freezes contracts; weaves PRs in dep order; runs calibrated audits; **solely owns the shared docs** (the plan, `infra/main.tf`, `pii-inventory.md`, this kanban); resolves cross-workstream contract drift; runs the staging→main promote cadence + drift cap. |
| **Workstream agent** | one session per work-order | Builds ONLY its owned modules on its own branch; runs `verify-before-commit`; opens a PR with a **doc-snippet** (the plan-row + any pii-inventory line) for the integrator to apply; reports status to the integrator (does NOT edit the kanban or shared docs). |

---

## 3. Hard rules (the drift killers)

1. **Disjoint ownership.** Each work-order lists the files/modules it may touch. You may create + edit ONLY those. If you think you need a file outside your set, stop and escalate to the integrator — do not edit it.
2. **Shared docs are integrator-only.** The plan, `infra/main.tf`, `pii-inventory.md`, this kanban, and `FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md` are edited **only by the integrator**, at weave time. Agents propose their plan-row / inventory updates as a **markdown snippet in the PR description**, not as a file edit.
   - **⚠️ Cross-project: `docs/roadmap/PII-Project/pii-inventory.md` is SHARED with the separate PII Governance program** (M1–M9), built in its own session, which also edits this file (per the CLAUDE.md Living-Inventory PR Rule — scheduling tables like `Booking` + `conversation-scheduling-session` hold consumer PII the PII program governs). The two programs WILL merge-conflict on it if they edit it at the same time (already happened once: scheduling #289 vs audit #290). **Rule:** before merging any scheduling PR that edits `pii-inventory.md`, the integrator **coordinates with the PII Governance session** (ping it / take turns) so the two never touch the file simultaneously. PII session owns the M1–M9 rows; the scheduling integrator owns the scheduling-surface rows; non-overlapping sections.
3. **Code against frozen contracts; never redefine them.** If a contract is wrong or missing, escalate — don't fork it.
4. **One workstream, one branch, one PR.** Branch naming: `feature/scheduling-<ws-id>` (lambda code → base `main`; picasso code/IaC → base `staging`). No cross-workstream commits.
5. **`verify-before-commit` on every commit** (the per-repo marker). No exceptions.
6. **Risk-calibrated audit at weave time** (§5). The integrator runs the full `phase-completion-audit` on security-sensitive merges; light smoke-verify on low-risk ones.
7. **Honor CLAUDE.md** — the SOP, the drift hard-cap (≤5 staging↔main merges; merge-commit strategy on promotes), the Living-Inventory PR rule, the schema-discipline (forward-compatible reads), the never-share-IAM-roles rule, the auto-mode credential-mutation gate.

## 4. Wave plan + dependency graph

### 4.0 Pre-launch (integrator) — ✅ DONE 2026-05-30
1. ✅ **§B contracts LOCKED** in `FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md`. Verified against canonical; **B4 corrected** (the 6 token purposes were wrong in the draft — now `cancel`/`reschedule`/`post_application_recovery`/`attended_yes`/`no_show`/`didnt_connect` per §13.4; one-time-use reuses the *existing* jti-blacklist table) and **B5 corrected** (the 4 verbatim §5.6 red-team cases + sanitization sub-steps).
2. ✅ **`shared/scheduling/` scaffolded** in the lambda repo ([lambda#181](https://github.com/longhornrumble/lambda/pull/181) — package.json + lockfile + jest + runtime deps pre-populated + README). Each Wave-1 pure-logic session (C4/C5/C7/C9/D1a) ADDS only its own `shared/scheduling/<module>.js` + `__tests__/<module>.test.js` and never touches `package.json`. C2 = BSH module; C8 = a Wave-2 commit Lambda; WS-EUI frontend home = **integrator confirms with the WS-EUI agent at launch** (the one remaining placement to settle).
3. ✅ **Zoom OAuth runbook published** — [`runbooks/ZOOM_OAUTH_PROVISIONING.md`](runbooks/ZOOM_OAUTH_PROVISIONING.md). Operator runs it in the background (credential mutation; ~30 min) before C8's Zoom path.

**Wave 1 is now LAUNCHABLE.** Spin up one session per work-order (WS-FIX first).

**Wave 1 — parallel (all owned modules are disjoint):**

| WS | Work-order | Plan task | Repo / base | Independent because |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WS-FIX** | [synthetic fixture](workstreams/WS-FIX-synthetic-fixture.md) | (enabler) | picasso → staging | seeds a read-only test tenant; everyone's integ tests use it |
| **WS-C2** | [form-data injection](workstreams/WS-C2-form-injection.md) | C2 | lambda → main | consumes the C1 GSI (frozen); no other WS dep |
| **WS-C4** | [freeBusy availability](workstreams/WS-C4-freebusy.md) | C4 | lambda → main | produces `AvailabilitySource` (frozen); consumes Google OAuth (done) |
| **WS-C5** | [routing eval](workstreams/WS-C5-routing-eval.md) | C5 | lambda → main | produces `evaluatePool` (frozen); consumes RoutingPolicy table (done) |
| **WS-C7** | [slot generation](workstreams/WS-C7-slot-gen.md) | C7 | lambda → main | pure logic; produces slot-chip shape (frozen) |
| **WS-C9** | [state machine](workstreams/WS-C9-state-machine.md) | C9 | lambda → main | consumes `booking-status` + ConvSchedSession table (done) |
| **WS-D1a** | [token middleware](workstreams/WS-D1a-token-middleware.md) | D1a, CI-3d | lambda → main | security-isolated; produces token-purpose enum (frozen) |
| **WS-EUI** | [Customer Portal UI](workstreams/WS-EUI-customer-portal.md) | E10–E16 | picasso → staging | builds against Booking schema + fixtures, not C8 internals |

**Wave 2 — sequential integration (integrator or a dedicated session, AFTER its inputs land):**

| Task | Plan | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C6 pool-at-commit** | C6 | WS-C4 + WS-C5 + WS-C7 merged | integrates the three; full audit (race conditions) |
| **C8 booking commit** | C8 | C6 + **Zoom OAuth provisioned** (§6) | the keystone; writes Booking rows → unblocks B9/B10/B11; full audit |
| **B9 / B10 / B11** | (routed from B) | C8 (real Booking writes) | the consumer logic deferred from sub-phase B |

**Recommended launch order:** WS-FIX **first** (others' integ tests want it), then WS-C4 / WS-C5 / WS-C7 / WS-C9 / WS-C2 / WS-D1a / WS-EUI in any order (all independent). Launch as many concurrently as you can supervise.

---

## 5. Risk-calibrated audit rule (lever #4)

> **Full `phase-completion-audit`** (≥3 adversarial reviewers + remediation) at weave time for any workstream touching: **prompt-injection / LLM input (C2)**, **race conditions or money/commit paths (C6, C8)**, **signed tokens / auth (D1a)**, **IAM / external surface / PII**.
>
> **Light verify** (the agent's `verify-before-commit` + an integrator smoke) for: **config / IaC tables, pure-logic modules with full unit coverage and no external surface (C7), additive UI surfaces (WS-EUI early)**.
>
> Rationale: B6's audit found real account-suspended-path bugs the live smoke couldn't — worth it. The 3 C3 tables were smoke-verified without a full audit — also right. Calibrate; don't reflexively over- or under-audit.

---

## 6. Operator gate — Zoom S2S OAuth (lever #3, do in background)

> **Full runbook: [`runbooks/ZOOM_OAUTH_PROVISIONING.md`](runbooks/ZOOM_OAUTH_PROVISIONING.md)** (published pre-launch). Summary below.

C8 is the only C task with an external gate. Provision ahead of reaching C8 so it's not a serial wait:

1. In the Zoom Marketplace, create a **Server-to-Server OAuth** app for the pilot tenant; scopes: `meeting:write:admin` (+ `meeting:read:admin`).
2. Store the creds in Secrets Manager at **`picasso/scheduling/zoom/{tenant_id}`** (mirror the Google OAuth secret shape — `account_id` / `client_id` / `client_secret`). Tag for the C8 exec role's per-tenant scope (no wildcard, per the never-share-IAM-roles + per-tenant-scope convention).
3. Verifier: `aws secretsmanager list-secrets --profile myrecruiter-staging --query "SecretList[?starts_with(Name,'picasso/scheduling/zoom/')].Name"`.

Until provisioned, C8 builds **Meet-first** (`conferenceData.createRequest`, rides the existing Google OAuth) + the `NullConferenceProvider` (no-op) per canonical §5.2 item 4; the `ZoomProvider` path lands once the secret exists.

## 7. Kanban (integrator-owned — agents report status in their PR, integrator updates here)

| WS | Branch | PR | Status | Blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WS-FIX | feature/scheduling-ws-fix | [#301](https://github.com/longhornrumble/picasso/pull/301) | MERGED 2026-05-30 | fixture `TEN-SCHED-FIXTURE` now available (staging, read-only) — see note below |

| WS-C9 | feature/scheduling-ws-c9 | [#185](https://github.com/longhornrumble/lambda/pull/185) | MERGED 2026-05-30 | — |
| WS-D1a | feature/scheduling-ws-d1a | [#186](https://github.com/longhornrumble/lambda/pull/186) | MERGED 2026-05-30 | remediated (empty-key/jti/expectedPurpose+tenant guards + fail-closed tests + SM-isolation), re-reviewed correct, operator-approved; CI green incl. the now-gating `shared/scheduling` job. Staging-safe (shared lib, no prod deploy). |
| WS-EUI | feature/scheduling-ws-eui | [dash#5](https://github.com/longhornrumble/picasso-analytics-dashboard/pull/5) | IN REVIEW — held for operator go-ahead | **E12+E15 in [dash#5]** (14 net-new files, +1218/-0, no existing-file edits; type-check/build/lint pass). **⚠️ merge=PROD deploy** (no staging) → integrator does NOT auto-merge. Nav deliberately unwired (separate App.tsx task) → pages deploy unreachable (≈zero blast radius). Red `Security Audit` = PRE-EXISTING repo-wide js-cookie/Clerk advisory (WS-EUI touched no package.json). **E11/E13/E14/E16 deferred.** Dashboard-repo debt flagged: no vitest CI job + 108 red tests on main (maintenance, out of scheduling scope). |
| C6 (Wave 2) | feature/scheduling-ws-c6 | [#189](https://github.com/longhornrumble/lambda/pull/189) | MERGED 2026-05-31 | `shared/scheduling/pool.js` — §10.2 select() + lockSlot() (conditional write on existing Booking table) + circuit-breaker + field-shim. 3-reviewer audit + verified remediation (re-offer dedup / poolSize+nextAttempt / breaker prune / booking_id). Deferred to C8: unconditional lock release + stale-lock runbook; propagate `format` to chip; durable degraded-state. |
| C8 (Wave 2) | — | — | ✅ READY TO BUILD | **C6 ✅ merged + Zoom pilot S2S provisioned** (operator-confirmed 2026-05-31, `picasso/scheduling/zoom/MYR384719`). Build Meet-first + NullConferenceProvider + ZoomProvider with **token-acquisition abstracted by secret shape** (S2S pilot → published-OAuth prod; see runbook Model). HIGH-RISK keystone (commit path → full audit + go-ahead). Writes Booking rows w/ `extendedProperties.private.booking_id` → unblocks B9/B10/B11. Folds the C6→C8 deferrals (unconditional lock release, stale-lock runbook, `format`-to-chip, durable degraded-state + the cosmetic JSDoc/`??` nits). |

**Status values:** NOT STARTED · IN PROGRESS · IN REVIEW (PR open) · MERGED · BLOCKED.

**Shared fixture (WS-FIX #301, merged):** `TEN-SCHED-FIXTURE` (staging, read-only synthetic tenant) — appt types `appt_1to1_discovery_30`/`appt_1to1_interview_60`; routing policies `rp_round_robin`/`rp_first_available`; bookings `bk_fixture_001/002/003` (all `booked`). Seed/teardown scripts in `scheduling/fixtures/`; runbook `scheduling/docs/runbooks/SCHEDULING_TEST_FIXTURE.md`. Other workstreams' integration tests reference these keys read-only. **Seed is operator-gated** (credential mutation) — scripts delivered, not yet run.

## 8. How to launch a workstream session

> **Operator step-by-step + all 8 ready-to-paste prompts: [`LAUNCH_THE_WORKFORCE.md`](LAUNCH_THE_WORKFORCE.md).**

Paste into a fresh Claude Code session, in order:
1. *"Read `scheduling/docs/workstreams/<WS>.md` — that is your work-order. Read the contracts it cites in `scheduling/docs/FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md`, the plan task it cites in `scheduling/docs/scheduling_implementation_plan.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Then build it within the ownership boundary. Open a PR per the work-order; do NOT touch any file outside your owned set or any shared doc."*
2. The agent builds → opens its PR with the doc-snippet → reports to you.
3. The **integrator session** weaves: review → calibrated audit → apply the doc-snippets to the shared docs → merge → update this kanban → manage drift/promote.
