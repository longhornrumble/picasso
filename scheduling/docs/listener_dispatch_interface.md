# Calendar_Watch_Listener — Dispatch Interface

**Purpose.** Contract between `Calendar_Watch_Listener` (sub-phase B2) and the booking-lifecycle consumers built in sub-phases C and E (C4 freeBusy cache, C8 booking record sync, C9 state machine). Engineers building B2 and C-phase consumers read this spec; it is not narrative.

**Reference.** Canonical design §14.2 (event taxonomy), §13 (token format), §5.1 (agent-of-CoR principle). Implementation plan B-phase tasks.

## Event-Type Vocabulary

Every event the listener may dispatch. No other event types exist in v1.

| Event type | Trigger condition |
|---|---|
| `booking.calendar_deleted` | Google `X-Goog-Resource-State: exists` → `events.get` returns 404 for a platform-owned event |
| `booking.calendar_moved` | Google push → `events.get` `start.dateTime` differs from `Booking.start_at` |
| `booking.calendar_reassigned` | Google push → `events.get` organizer or accepted attendee no longer matches `Booking.resource_id` |
| `booking.ooo_overlap_detected` | Google push → new OOO-type event's time range overlaps ≥1 `booked` booking for the same coordinator |
| `booking.attendee_accepted` | Google push → `events.get` attendee `responseStatus` changed to `accepted` |
| `booking.attendee_declined` | Google push → `events.get` attendee `responseStatus` changed to `declined` |
| `booking.event_made_private` | Google push → `events.get` `visibility` changed to `private` |

## Payload Schema

All events share a common envelope. Per-type fields follow.

### Common envelope

```json
{
  "event_type": "string",           // one of the seven types above
  "event_id": "string",             // == Booking PK (booking_id); stable across retries
  "tenant_id": "string",
  "booking_id": "string",
  "last_calendar_mutation_at": "string", // ISO-8601; from events.get updated field
  "dispatched_at": "string",        // ISO-8601; wall clock at listener invocation
  "calendar_provider": "google"     // "microsoft" reserved for v2
}
```

### booking.calendar_moved — additional fields

```json
{
  "previous_start_at": "string",    // ISO-8601; from Booking.start_at before update
  "new_start_at": "string",         // ISO-8601; from events.get start.dateTime
  "previous_end_at": "string",
  "new_end_at": "string"
}
```

### booking.calendar_reassigned — additional fields

```json
{
  "previous_resource_id": "string", // coordinator email before reassignment
  "new_resource_id": "string"       // new organizer/accepted-attendee email
}
```

### booking.ooo_overlap_detected — additional fields

```json
{
  "ooo_start_at": "string",         // ISO-8601
  "ooo_end_at": "string",
  "overlapping_booking_ids": ["string"]  // all affected booking_ids
}
```

Note: `booking_id` in the envelope is set to the first overlapping booking; the full list is in `overlapping_booking_ids`.

### booking.attendee_accepted / booking.attendee_declined — additional fields

```json
{
  "attendee_email": "string",       // the attendee whose responseStatus changed
  "response_status": "accepted | declined"
}
```

### booking.event_made_private — no additional fields

## Idempotency Expectations

Each consumer MUST be idempotent. The same event may arrive more than once (SQS at-least-once delivery; Google may send duplicate push notifications).

**Dedupe key:** `(event_id, last_calendar_mutation_at)`. Consumers check this pair against a processed-events record before acting. Processing the same `(event_id, last_calendar_mutation_at)` twice produces the same outcome as processing it once.

No consumer may reject a message solely because it has already processed it — log and discard; do not DLQ.

---

## Error Contract

| Scenario | B2 behavior |
|---|---|
| Consumer absent (no SQS subscriber yet) | B2 logs the event and continues. v1 ships consumer stubs for C4, C8, C9 so the queue always has a subscriber. |
| Consumer throws / returns non-2xx | SQS redrive to DLQ after configured max-receive-count. DLQ alarm fires (wired to `picasso-ops-alerts-{env}` — staging: `picasso-ops-alerts-staging` per [plan §4 line 132 VERIFIED](scheduling_implementation_plan.md#L132); prod: `picasso-ops-alerts-prod` reserved for Phase-2 cutover). |
| Payload fails schema validation | B2 logs full payload + validation error, sends to DLQ, fires alarm. Listener Lambda does NOT crash — process continues for subsequent push notifications. |
| `events.get` returns 403 (event made private) | Emit `booking.event_made_private`. Do not attempt to read event body. Log degradation. |

---

## Ordering Guarantees

- Events for the same `event_id` (same booking) are sent to an **SQS FIFO queue** and processed in order. Message group key = `event_id`.
- Events for different `event_id` values may be processed concurrently. Consumers must not assume cross-booking ordering.
- Listener Lambda may coalesce multiple Google push notifications for the same calendar into a single `events.get` call before dispatching — this is an optimization detail internal to B2 and does not affect the dispatch contract.

## Named Consumers

| Consumer | Sub-phase | Event types consumed |
|---|---|---|
| **C4** freeBusy cache invalidation | C | `booking.calendar_moved`, `booking.calendar_deleted`, `booking.ooo_overlap_detected` |
| **C8** booking record sync | C | All types |
| **C9** state machine transitions | C | `booking.calendar_deleted`, `booking.attendee_declined`, `booking.calendar_moved` |

## Change log

| Date | Change | Author |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-02 | Initial — derived from canonical §14.2 event taxonomy and §13 token/payload constraints | Chris + Claude |
| 2026-05-25 | Drift correction: SNS topic name `picasso-ops-alerts` → `picasso-ops-alerts-{env}` (`-staging` is canonical in staging-525 per `{name}-{env}` naming convention). Closes audit row 8 from `project_scheduling_subphase_b_phase_completion_audit_2026-05-25`. | Chris + Claude |
